# Favorites Manager UI Plugin

## General

Access your favorite assets quickly by them to the your personal favorites list. You can mark any device, group or Digital Twin Manager asset as your favorite. No special permissions are needed to use this plugin, as the list of favorites is managed per account in the [currentUser](https://cumulocity.com/api/core/#tag/Current-User) object. Therefore, favorites are independent of individual sessions and the browser being used for a session.

**Important:** This Favorites Manager plugin will not work for users, which are managed via SSO (e.g. Azure Active Directory). The corresponding user object of these SSO users is immutable and can't be updated. File an [issue](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-favorites-manager-plugin/issues) if you require this plugin for SSO users.

## Local development

### Recommended version

- node v 14.x
- npm v 6.x

### Plugin versions

- Angular v 14.x
- WebSDK v 1017.0.x

**How to start**
Change the target tenant and application you want to run this plugin on in the `package.json`.

```
c8ycli server -u https://{{your-tenant}}.cumulocity.com/ --shell {{cockpit}}
```

Keep in mind that this plugin needs to have an app (e.g. cockpit) running with at least the same version as this plugin. if your tenant contains an older version, use the c8ycli to create a cockpit clone running with at least v 1017.0.x! Upload this clone to the target tenant (e.g. cockpit-1017) and reference this name in the --shell command.

The widget plugin can be locally tested via the start script:

```
npm start
```

In the Module Federation terminology, `widget` plugin is called `remote` and the `cokpit` is called `shell`. Modules provided by this `widget` will be loaded by the `cockpit` application at the runtime. This plugin provides a basic custom widget that can be accessed through the `Add widget` menu.

> Note that the `--shell` flag creates a proxy to the cockpit application and provides` AdvancedMapWidgetModule` as an `remote` via URL options.

Also deploying needs no special handling and can be simply done via `npm run deploy`. As soon as the application has exports it will be uploaded as a plugin.
